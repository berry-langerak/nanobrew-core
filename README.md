# Nanobrew Core

This is the core of the Nanobrew software. Nanobrew is brewing automation
software which can be installed on a Raspberry PI. It can control your brewery,
by hooking up sensors, and actors like pumps and heaters. The software can then
control the temperature, or even the entire brew day flow.

This is currently an active work in progress. The aim is to have core functionality 
up and running in a few weeks so it's possible to start working on plugins.

## Developer notes

This repository contains the core. The aim is to build a strong, stable and 
reliable core and add functionality through plugins. This way, the development 
of this product is in the hands of the community that creates plugins.

Of course, the core itself is also open source (see LICENSE), so any and all
additions are more than welcome!
